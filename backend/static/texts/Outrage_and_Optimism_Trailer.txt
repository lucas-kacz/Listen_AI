Hello everyone, I'm Cristiana Figueres and in my role at the United Nations I had the pleasure of bringing all countries together for the...for the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I was optimistic about our future then, and I am optimistic now.But frankly, I am also outraged that we're not moving forward as quickly as we have to. Because of this, together with my good friend,with my good friends Tom Karnak and Paul Dickinson. I'm launching this new podcast entitled Outrage and Optimism.You will hear from great leaders like Jane Goodall, Greta Thunberg and David Addenborough.wars, about people winning wars and losing wars. That has to change. The history of the future has to be about agreements.I hope you join us, subscribe on iTunes, Stitcher or wherever you get your podcasts. And finally, remember, impossible.impossible is not a fact. It is an attitude and we are running out of time.

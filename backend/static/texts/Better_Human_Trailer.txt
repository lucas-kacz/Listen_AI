Hi, I'm Chris Duffy, and I am the host of Ted's new podcast, How to Be a Better Human. Every week, I'm going to be in Congress.I'm going to be in conversation with guests and past speakers and smart people from all over the world who are going to offer actionable insights on how to be a little less terrible asas partners, listeners, allies, activists, and all the other ways that we're human. Maybe you're trying to get it together for yourself. It's a great question too.to really put yourself in the driver's seat to say, is this helping or harming me in my quest to get through this?get through this.and to connect through conversation, you have to be able to share your hopes, your dreams, your emotions. You have to be open. You have to get the other person to be open. Or perhaps even the world.perhaps even the world.person sees the world or somebody else.Let's start right here, because it's not just about being a good person. It's about learning how to be a better human.Coming January 11th, wherever you listen to podcasts.you
